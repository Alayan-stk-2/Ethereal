# Ethereal

Ethereal is a UCI-compliant chess engine. It uses the traditional alpha-beta framework in addition to a variety of pruning, reduction, extension, and other improvements. Some of those improvements include Static Null Move Pruning, Null Move Pruning, Depth Based Futility Pruning, Best-Case Delta Pruning, Current-Move Delta Pruning, Late Move Reductions, Check extensions, and the use of various Transposition Tables. Ethereal generates moves using the Fancy Magic BitBoard technique, but also uses a redundant 64-length array to store pieces for easier lookup. Ethereal is an original engine, however, it is greatly influenced from Crafty, Stockfish, TSCP, MadChess, and Fruit.
