# Ethereal

Ethereal is a UCI compliant Chess Engine based on the minimax search algorithm. Aside from serving as a Chess Engine, it also aims to serve as an example of my work to show future educational facilities and potential employers. This project is developed entirely outside of any training received at my current college, and highlights the skills and knowledge that I have acquired outside of any educational facility.
