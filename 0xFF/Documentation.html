	<h1> Ethereal Chess </h1>

	<p> Ethereal Chess is an chess engine developed during my highschool years and first year of university. This project aims to explore the various methods of game-tree search and evaluation, as well as a variety of topics such as; effective bit fields, cache friendly programming, multi-processing. Like any personal project, this project will never be completly finished, and I hope to continue to develop Ethereal Chess as I progress through University </p>


	<h3> Board Representation </h3>

	<p> Ethereal Boards are represented as a single integer array of length 256, while being visualized as a 16x16 array. The increased size allows an 8x8 standard chess board to be embedded inside the 16x16 array, and allows for bounds checkout with a single comparision, destination != WALL. The non embedded 8x8 portion of the array is all set to a value WALL. </p>
	
	<h3> Move Representation </h3>
	
	<p> All Moves are stored in a 32 bit unsigned integer, and are defined as follows </p>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<th> Move Type </th>
			<th> Bits 00-07 </th>
			<th> Bits 08-15 </th>
			<th> Bits 16-23 </th>
			<th> Bits 24-27 </th>
			<th> Bits 28-29 </th>
			<th> Bit 30 </th>
			<th> Bit 31 </th>
